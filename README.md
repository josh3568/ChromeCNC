/*Things I will learn from this project:
* GitHub
* Eclipse
* Java Script
* C/C++
* GCode
* Programming conventions
* Embedded systems design
* writing test code in eclipse
*/

/* Design criteria
* Use a chrome browser as a user interface to pass commands down to an arduino
* Should have a box to paste and execute GCode
* Control the arduino manually with fwd/back buttons
*
* Run a small program with GCode commands
* If i have time: convert characters into GCode commands (ie a generates code to write "a" on a piece of paper)
