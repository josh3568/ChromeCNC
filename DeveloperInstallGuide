Feel good guys, I took on all the headache figuring out how to do this...
The following is a guide of installing the development software. Below is a list of software required to running Eclipse:

1) Java RE
2) MinGW
3) Eclipse Neon
4) CUTE
5) Sloeber V4


1) install Java RE
Find your computer architecture:
Goto Windows Explorer > right-click my computer > Properties > FInd system type. It should say if you have a 32 or 64 bit windows.

Goto http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html and select the latest JRE version for your windows architecture
Download the .exe file and not the .tar.gz file
Run the downloaded application and follow the prompts

2) Install MinGW
I couldn't get teh mingw-get-setup.exe to work, but I was able to download the MinGW files manually here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get/mingw-get-0.6.1-beta-20130910-1/
Download mingw-get-0.6.1-mingw32-beta-20130910-1-bin.zip and extract. Your extracted folder should contain the folders: bin, include, lib, lib32, libexec, manual, share, and x86_64-w64-mingw32
Rename the extracted "mingw-get-0.6.1-mingw32-beta-20130910-1-bin" folder to "MinGW" and paste into the C:\ drive
(C:/MinGW)

3) Install Eclipse Neon
You'll have to decide on what version of Eclipse to use based on the software requirements of Sloeber V4 and CUTE. 
Through some back and forth testing, I discovered you should use Eclipse Neon. Download it here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/neon3
Once downloaded, copy the "eclipse" folder into your C drive (C:/eclipse)

4) Install CUTE
CUTE is an Eclipse plug-in allowing the programmer to write unit tests
The install guide is found here: http://www.cute-test.com/projects/cute/wiki/CUTE_Installation_and_System_Requirements
Follow the steps found in "Installing CUTE Using the CUTE Updatesite" but use the following modifications:
For step 3, use link http://www.cute-test.com/updatesite/neon instead of http://www.cute-test.com/updatesite/
For step 4, download all items (select all check boxes). I ran into issues if the plug-in is only downloaded

Follow the guide http://www.cute-test.com/projects/cute/wiki/Using_the_CUTE_Eclipse_Plug-in
The Test.cpp should have all default code. All prompts should be default. You should get a red bar
Change ASSERTM("start writing tests", false); to ASSERTM("start writing tests", true); and verify you get a green bar

5) Install Sloeber V4
Sloeber V4 is an Eclipse plug-in allowing you to download code to the Arduino
Goto Help > Eclipse Marketplace > type in "arduino" in the search bar > Find "The Arduino Eclipse plugin named Sloeber V4" and select the install button
Go through all prompts and accept that you do NOT have a verify signature. Restart eclipse
http://eclipse.baeyens.it/how_to.shtml#/c1

For some reason, the file > new project will become disabled. The workaround is to right-click in the project folder and select new > project

6) Test an Arduino download
Plug the Arduino into the computer, determine your COM port
In Windows, goto Control panel > Device Manager > Ports > Make note of the Arduino COM port (mine is COM3)
In Eclipse, goto arduino > new sketch > Use the default Platform folder > Populate the rest from your Arduino specs
Paste the following code into .ino file from your newly created Arduino sketch
Select upload button

#include "Arduino.h"
//The setup function is called once at startup of the sketch
void setup()
{
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// The loop function is called in an endless loop
void loop()
{
// wait for a second
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
delay(1000); // wait for a second
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
delay(1000);
}

7) Make an Arduino test
